# Valorant Tracking by NavisGames
Would you like to use the many functions of the Valorant API to see the rank of your opponents or your mates? Or rather get the match history with K/D from the player? Or just the ranking of the best players in Europe or North America? With this program, which I programmed with Python and PyQT5, you can currently

A) See Account Level

B) See a player's rank and MMR

C) See how much plus or minus he made

D) See his last 5 matches

E) See global leaderboard in each region

and soon View match data from a match.

I know that there are already many other apps like Valorant Tracker or Blitz but this program is not in-game but can also be used outside of Valorant.
(If you can remember a player's name and hashtag)

Valorant Tracker and Blitz are definitely better. But my program is in beta. So if you look at the full release that will come at some point, you will notice differences to the beta. SO if you are looking for better programs -> Valorant Tracker | Blitz.gg AND if you want to use functions outside of Valorant and functions that may not exist -> Valorant Tracking

Thank you for reading :)


Q&A
-----
Q:  Why is the program detected/flagged as a virus?


A:  IMPORTANT!
    Stay calm. The program is NOT a virus.
    The program I used to make Python into an EXE file is called PyInstaller.
    Lots of viruses, key loggers and other B!llsh!t
    are also built with Python and PyInstaller.
    i.e
    Py to Exe is not a real compiler, but just a container in Exe format, which when you start it, in addition to your Py file, also secretly writes the necessary    runtime to disk and also executes it automatically.
    This behavior is heuristically consistent with Trojans and other malware. Security programs react accordingly.
    To prove that this program is NOT A VIRUS, here is a VirusTotal Link: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/185c8c612d23263130cfddd2b14755b663cd18b5de6725acb459909628b6a0d0
