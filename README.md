Q&A
-----
Q:  Why is the program detected/flagged as a virus?


A:  IMPORTANT!
    Stay calm. The program is NOT a virus.
    The program I used to make Python into an EXE file is called PyInstaller.
    Lots of viruses, key loggers and other B!llsh!t
    are also built with Python and PyInstaller.
    i.e
    Py to Exe is not a real compiler, but just a container in Exe format, which when you start it, in addition to your Py file, also secretly writes the necessary    runtime to disk and also executes it automatically.
    This behavior is heuristically consistent with Trojans and other malware. Security programs react accordingly.
    To prove that this program is NOT A VIRUS, here is a VirusTotal Link: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/185c8c612d23263130cfddd2b14755b663cd18b5de6725acb459909628b6a0d0
