## Q&A

Q:  Why is the program detected/flagged as a virus?

A:  IMPORTANT! Stay calm. The program is NOT a virus. The program I used to make Python into an EXE file is called
PyInstaller. Lots of viruses, keyloggers and other Bad stuff are also built with Python and PyInstaller. i.e. Py to Exe
is not a real compiler, but just a container in Exe format, which when you start it, in addition to your Py file, also
secretly writes the necessary runtime to disk and also executes it automatically. This behavior is heuristically
consistent with Trojans and other malware. Security programs react accordingly. To prove that this program is NOT A
VIRUS, here is a VirusTotal

> im currently working on a fix for this so no worries :)



Q: What if my Names have spaces

A:  No problem! Just put the spaces in the program. The program recognizes the spaces ^^

Q: What if there are any Bugs in the programm? How should I report them.

A: Simply open an Issue :) I will look at it as soon as I have time.
