Q&A
-------
Q:  Why is the program detected/flagged as a virus?

A:  IMPORTANT!
    Stay calm. The program is NOT a virus.
    The program I used to make Python into an EXE file is called PyInstaller.
    Lots of viruses, key loggers and other B!llsh!t
    are also built with Python and PyInstaller.
    i.e
    Py to Exe is not a real compiler, but just a container in Exe format, which when you start it, in addition to your Py file, also secretly writes the necessary    runtime to disk and also executes it automatically.
    This behavior is heuristically consistent with Trojans and other malware. Security programs react accordingly.
    To prove that this program is NOT A VIRUS, here is a VirusTotal Link: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/185c8c612d23263130cfddd2b14755b663cd18b5de6725acb459909628b6a0d0
     
     
     im currently working on a fix for this so no worries :)

Q: What if my Names have spaces

A:  No problem! Just put the spaces in the program. The program recognizes the spaces ^^
